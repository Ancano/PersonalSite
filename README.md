# PersonalSite #

### What is this? ###

This is a personal website I am building using the Python web framework Flask, templating language Jinja, SQL, HTML, and CSS. It uses Bootstrap for UI. I plan to use it as a hub to showcase additional code projects I work on in the future.

### Features ###
The website has several fully implemented functions/features:
* Admin Control Panel - Allows admin to read messages sent from the "Contact" page.
* Gallery - A gallery containing images uploaded and captioned by the admin.
* Contact Page - A page that allows anyone to send the admin a message, which can be read on their control panel.
* Projects Section - A page for showcasing code projects.

### Dependencies ###
flask and flask-bootstrap which can both be installed with pip.
