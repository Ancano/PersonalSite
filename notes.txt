Jinja delimiters:

{% ... %} for Statements
{{ ... }} for Expressions to print to the template output
{# ... #} for Comments not included in the template output
#Â  ... ## for Line Statements

to pass a var from python into the html do
{{ my_string }}

nice idea: for your root index, never use a render template directly but rather create a layout template which can be inherited
by all subtemplates which are actually directly used
